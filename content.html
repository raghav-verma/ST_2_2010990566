                        During the American Revolutionary War, an influx of British settlers came here as United Empire
                        Loyalists fled for the British-controlled lands north of Lake Ontario. The Crown granted them
                        land
                        to compensate for their losses in the Thirteen Colonies. The new province of Upper Canada was
                        being
                        created and needed a capital. In 1787, the British Lord Dorchester arranged for the Toronto
                        Purchase
                        with the Mississauga of the New Credit First Nation, thereby securing more than a quarter of a
                        million acres (1000 km2) of land in the Toronto area. Dorchester intended the location to be
                        named Toronto. The first 25 years after the Toronto purchase was quiet, although "there were
                        occasional independent fur traders" present in the area, with the usual complaints of debauchery
                        and
                        drunkenness.

                    <p>
                        In 1793, Governor John Graves Simcoe established the town of York on the Toronto Purchase lands,
                        naming it after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Simcoe decided to move the Upper
                        Canada
                        capital from Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake) to York, believing the new site would be less
                        vulnerable to attack by the United States. The York garrison was built at the entrance of the
                        town's natural harbour, sheltered by a long sand-bar peninsula. The town's settlement formed at
                        the
                        harbour's eastern end behind the peninsula, near the present-day intersection of Parliament
                        Street
                        and Front Street (in the "Old Town" area).

                    When Europeans first arrived at the site of present-day Toronto, the vicinity was inhabited by the
                    Iroquois, who had displaced the Wyandot (Huron) people, occupants of the region for centuries
                    before c. 1500. The name Toronto is likely derived from the Mohawk word tkaronto, meaning "place
                    where trees stand in the water". This refers to the northern end of what is now Lake Simcoe,
                    where the Huron had planted tree saplings to corral fish. However, the word "Toronto", meaning
                    "plenty" also appears in a 1632 French lexicon of the Huron language, which is also an Iroquoian
                    language. It also appears on French maps referring to various locations, including Georgian Bay,
                    Lake Simcoe, and several rivers. A portage route from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron running through
                    this point, known as the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, led to widespread use of the name. The site
                    of Toronto lay at the entrance to one of the oldest routes to the northwest, a route known and used
                    by the Huron, Iroquois, and Ojibwe, and was of strategic importance from the beginning of Ontario's
                    recorded history.

                    In the 1660s, the Iroquois established two villages within what is today Toronto, Ganatsekwyagon on
                    the banks of the Rouge River and Teiaiagon on the banks of the Humber River. By 1701, the
                    Mississauga had displaced the Iroquois, who abandoned the Toronto area at the end of the Beaver
                    Wars, with most returning to their contentland in present-day New York.

                    In the 17th century, the area was a crucial link for travel, with the Humber and Rouge rivers
                    providing a shortcut to the upper Great Lakes. These routes together were known as the Toronto
                    Passage.
                    French traders founded Fort Rouillé in 1750 (the current Exhibition grounds were later developed
                    here), but abandoned it in 1759 during the Seven Years' War. The British defeated the French and
                    their indigenous allies in the war, and the area became part of the British colony of Quebec in
                    1763.
